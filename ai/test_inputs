You are playing Algo with your friend. Algo is a game where each player takes turns guessing their opponent's cards' numbers.

Now it is your turn to guess! 

You will be given your hand A (4 <= |A| <= 12) and your opponent's hand B (|A| <= |B| <= |A| + 1). 

Each player's hand consists of cards will be a tuple {x, c} (-1 <= x <= 11, 0 <= c <= 1). x is the card's value and c is the card's color. You may think of 0 as the color black and 1 as the color white. If a card's value is -1, then that means that card's value is unknown to you.

You will obviously know all of the values of all cards in your hand. However, it is guaranteed that there is at least one card in your opponent's hand that you do not know the value of.

For each unknown card in your opponent's hand, print the probability that it is of value x.
